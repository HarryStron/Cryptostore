# CryptoStore #

CryptoStore is a solution for securing sensitive files on remote servers. CryptoStore is a zero-knowledge cloud storage application which encrypts your files locally (on your machine) and then sends them over to the remote server which has no knowledge of what the files stored on it are. The files are only decrypted when they reach back to their owner as no passwords are stored anywhere outside the user's machine.
